in this assignment we will write a program to analyze the word frequency in a document
because the number of words in the document may not be known a prior we will implement a
dynamically doubling array to store the necessary information
please read all the directions before writing code as this write up contains specific
requirements for how the code should be written
there are two files on moodle one contains text to be read and analyzed and is named
tomSawyertxt as the name implies this file contains the full text from tom sawyer for your
convenience all the punctuation has been removed all the words have been converted to
lowercase and the entire document can be read as if it were written on a single line the other
file contains the fivety most common words in the english language which your program will
ignore during analysis it is called ignoreWordstxt
your program must take three command line arguments in the following order a
number n the name of the text to be read and the name of the text file with the words that
should be ignored it will read the text ignoring the words in the second file and store all
unique words in a dynamically doubling array it should then calculate and print the following
information yes no said say nothing something fun ugh why monkey queen four two three one seven
legs skinny nuts funny code hats hat hop hello world vocabulary weather wet
